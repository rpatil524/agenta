# LangGraph

[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends LangChain's capabilities by enabling the creation of complex workflows as directed graphs where nodes represent different processing steps and edges define the flow between them.
