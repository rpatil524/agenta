## The Problem

Building agentic applications that interact with external services means writing integration code: OAuth flows, API wrappers, error handling. You do all of that before you can even test whether your prompt works with the tool.

## The Solution

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "20px", flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center'}}>
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="500"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEbwJhdTQds"
    title="Tool Integrations in the Playground"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

You can now connect external tools to your prompts and call them from the playground. Browse a catalog of 150+ integrations, authenticate with OAuth or an API key, and attach tool actions to your prompt config. When the LLM generates a tool call, you execute it with one click and send the result back to the chat.

## What You Can Do

- **Use Google Sheets or Notion as data sources.** Connect a spreadsheet or Notion database and let the LLM query it. Build RAG applications directly from the playground without writing any code.
- **Send emails and messages.** Attach Gmail or Slack and your prompt can draft and send emails, post to channels, or create threads.
- **Automate developer workflows.** Connect GitHub to create issues, Jira to update tickets, or any of the 150+ available integrations.
- **Manage connections in Settings.** A dedicated Tools page shows all your connected integrations, their status, and lets you add or revoke connections.

## How It Works

1. Go to **Settings > Tools** and connect an integration (e.g., Gmail). You authenticate via OAuth or paste an API key.
2. In the Playground, open the tools panel in your prompt config. Your connected integrations appear there.
3. Select the actions you want available to the LLM (e.g., "Send Email", "List Emails").
4. Run your prompt. When the LLM generates a tool call, click "Execute" to run it and return the result to the conversation.

## Getting Started

Tool integrations are available on Agenta Cloud. Connect your first integration in **Settings > Tools**.
