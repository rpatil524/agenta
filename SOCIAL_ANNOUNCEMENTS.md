## Tool Integrations in the Playground

### LinkedIn

150+ tool integrations are live in the Agenta Playground.

You can connect Gmail, Slack, Notion, Google Sheets, GitHub, and other services directly to your prompts. Authenticate with OAuth, pick the actions you want, and test everything from the playground.

Some examples of what you can build without writing integration code:
- Use a Google Sheet as a data source and build RAG from the UI
- Have your prompt draft and send emails through Gmail
- Post to Slack channels based on LLM output
- Create GitHub issues from structured extraction prompts

Provider-native tools (web search, code execution, file search) also work out of the box.

## AI Prompt Refinement

### LinkedIn

Are you still writing your prompts by hand? AI is much better at writing prompts.

When we talked to our users, we discovered that a lot of them copy-pasted the prompt into ChatGPT, edited it there, and then went back. So we improved the flow. Now you click the wand icon, type what you want to change, and get back your refined version.

The prompt refiner itself was built with Agenta, and it includes all the best practices for writing clear prompts that work well.

Since we started using it internally, my flow is just talking through what I want using Wispr Flow ("make it more concise", "add output format constraints") and hitting refine. Prompt iteration got way faster.

Try it in the Playground: https://cloud.agenta.ai

**AI Prompt Refinement is live in the Playground**

You can now refine prompts with AI directly in the Playground:

- Click the wand icon on any prompt section
- Describe what you want to change in plain English
- Get a refined version with a summary of changes
- Iterate: each round builds on the previous result
- Toggle diff view to see exactly what changed
- Edit the result before applying

There's also a quick "Optimize using best practices" shortcut.

## Folders for Prompt Organization

### LinkedIn

Folders are live in Agenta.

Prompts pile up when you're building agents. We added folders so you can organize them. Create folders, drag prompts into them, nest subfolders. Works like a file system.

Folder URLs persist, so you can link teammates to the right place.
